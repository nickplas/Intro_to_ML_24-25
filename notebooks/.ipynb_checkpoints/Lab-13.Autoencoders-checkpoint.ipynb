This objective is known as reconstruction, and is accomplished through an encoder and a decoder:\n","* the encoder compresses the input data into a lower-dimensional representation that captures the most important features or patterns;\n","* the decoder reconstructs the original data from the compressed representation.\n","\n","The compressed representation learned by an autoencoder can be visualized as a lower-dimensional space, where similar inputs are mapped to nearby points and dissimilar inputs are mapped to distant points. This makes autoencoders useful for tasks such as dimensionality reduction, anomaly detection, and generative modeling.\n","\n","**NOTE:** *If linear activations are used, or only a single sigmoid hidden layer, then the optimal solution to an autoencoder is strongly related to principal component analysis (PCA). However, the potential of autoencoders resides in their non-linearity, allowing the model to learn more powerful generalizations compared to PCA, and to reconstruct the input with significantly lower information loss.*"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"69f0cee2","metadata":{"id":"69f0cee2"},"outputs":[],"source":["# import all needed packages \n","import torch\n","import torch.nn as nn\n","import torch.utils.data as data\n","import torchvision\n","import numpy as np\n","import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n","from time import time\n","import random\n","\n","# reproducibility\n","torch.manual_seed(1)\n","np.random.seed(2)\n","random.seed(3)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"5616f9bd","metadata":{"id":"5616f9bd"},"outputs":[],"source":["# Set arguments\n","batch_size = 128\n","\n","# DataLoader Train\n","trainset = torchvision.datasets.MNIST(root='./data', train=True, download=True,\n","    transform=torchvision.transforms.ToTensor())\n","\n","trainloader = data.DataLoader(trainset, batch_size=batch_size, shuffle=True)\n","\n","\n","# DataLoader Test\n","testset = torchvision.datasets.MNIST(root='./data', train=False, download=True,\n","    transform=torchvision.transforms.ToTensor())\n","\n","testloader = data.DataLoader(testset, batch_size=16, shuffle=False)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"-db4fr6Jb4Fl","metadata":{"id":"-db4fr6Jb4Fl"},"source":["## Training"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"q2kjJyRcV78X","metadata":{"id":"q2kjJyRcV78X"},"source":["##### **1.
